I am a third-year student in École Polytechnique, pursuing an engineering degree([Diplôme d'Ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipl%C3%B4me_d%27Ing%C3%A9nieur)), 
majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Before coming to France, I learned Physics in Nanjing University, China, obtained my bachelor's degree with honours. 

I am interested in artificial intelligence such as robotics and autonomous driving. I like doing research and aim at pursuing a doctor degree 
after my engineering course in Ecole Polytechnique, for that I can learn more about artificial intelligence, 
and maybe contribute a little to this domain.
